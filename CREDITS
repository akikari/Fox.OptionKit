Project Philosophy
------------------

Fox.OptionKit embodies a set of core design principles that guide its development:

Type-Safe Optional Values
  The library is built on the principle that null values should be replaced with
  explicit Option<T> types, making the presence or absence of values part of the
  type system. This design choice prevents NullReferenceExceptions and provides
  compile-time safety.

Explicit Over Implicit
  All optional values are explicitly wrapped in Option<T>, making the contract
  clear and discoverable. There are no hidden null checks or magic conventions—
  what you see is what you get.

Functional Composition
  Leveraging functional programming patterns (Map, Bind, Match), Fox.OptionKit
  enables clean, composable code that handles optional values without nested
  null checks or try-catch blocks.

Zero External Dependencies
  The library deliberately has no external dependencies beyond the .NET base
  library. This decision ensures long-term stability, eliminates dependency
  conflicts, and maintains a minimal attack surface.

Developer Experience
  Clear error messages, IntelliSense-friendly APIs, and comprehensive XML
  documentation are first-class concerns. The library is designed to be intuitive
  for C# developers familiar with functional programming concepts.


Architectural Decisions
------------------------

Fox.OptionKit (Core Library)
  The core library provides a minimal, dependency-free Option<T> implementation
  with three main components:

  1. Option<T> Struct - Immutable, type-safe container for optional values
  2. Factory Methods - Option.Some<T>() and Option.None<T>() for creating options
  3. Functional Operations - Map, Bind, Match for composing operations on optional values
  4. Extension Methods - ToOption() for converting nullable types

  The architecture deliberately avoids complex abstractions, favoring simple,
  testable components that follow functional programming principles (functor and
  monad laws).

No Integration Packages (By Design)
  Unlike other Fox.*Kit libraries, Fox.OptionKit is intentionally standalone with
  no integration packages. The Option<T> pattern is fundamental and should remain
  dependency-free to maximize adoption across different project architectures.


Inspirations
------------

This project draws inspiration from:

  - F# Option Type - The canonical implementation of optional values in .NET
  - Rust's Option<T> - Ergonomic API design and pattern matching
  - Haskell's Maybe - Monadic composition principles
  - Railway Oriented Programming (Scott Wlaschin) - Functional error handling patterns
  - Functional Programming Principles - Type safety, immutability, composition
